# 📚 Programming Study Repository

Daily practice of algorithms, data structures, and programming concepts. One problem per day, continuous learning.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- **Master algorithms and data structures fundamentals**
- **Improve problem-solving skills through daily practice**
- **Build a strong foundation in computer science concepts**
- **Document learning journey for continuous improvement**

## 📖 Study Approach

- **One problem per day** with thorough analysis
- **Multiple approaches** when possible (brute force → optimized)
- **Time/space complexity** analysis for each solution
- **Learning notes** to capture insights and patterns
